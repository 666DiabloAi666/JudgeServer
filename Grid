The structure of electricity delivery can be categorized into three functions: generation, transmission, 
and distribution, all of which are linked through key assets known as substations. Even though power 
infrastructure is highly redundant and resilient, customer outages do occur as a result of system 
disruptions.

3.1 GENERATION 
Number, Capacity, and Fuel Mix
In 2014 there were 19,023 individual, commercial generators at 6,997 operational power plants in the 
United States. A power plant can have one or more generators, and some generators have the ability to
use more than one type of fuel. Power supply in the United States is generated from a diverse fuel mix. 
In 2014, fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and petroleum liquids accounted for 67 percent of U.S. 
electricity generation and 89 percent of installed capacity.

Generation capacity also varies by State and can be dependent upon the availability of the fuel resource. 
Coal and gas power plants are more common in the Midwest and Southeast whereas the West Coast is 
dependent upon high-capacity hydroelectric power as well as gas-fired power plants. Power generation 
fuels also have a supply chain of their own. Coal, natural gas, uranium, and oil must all be extracted, 
processed into useable fuels, and delivered to the generation facility. Vast infrastructure networks of 
railroads, pipelines, waterways, highways, and processing plants support the delivery of these resources 
to generating facilities, and many rely on electric power to operate.
