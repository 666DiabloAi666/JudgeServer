Update of Purchase Order
Use
If the user changes the sales order in SAP CRM, the purchase order ( PO ) is updated.

When a sales order is changed in SAP CRM, a distinction is made between:

Changes before the PO is created

Changes after the PO has been created

Changes beforePOcreation
If the PO has not yet been released, any type of change is possible. You can, for example, change the source of supply, switch an item from an external vendor/supplier to an in-house location, or vice versa. In addition, backorder processing (BOP) that is run in SAP SCM can cause changes to a third-party item (provided that it results from rules-based ATP).

Changes afterPOcreation
If the PO has already been released and created in the ERP system, changes from a sourcing procedure or a BOP run are prohibited. You can, however, still make manual changes.

If SAP SPM receives a PO confirmation, it validates the confirmation received from the vendor/supplier and updates the purchase order with the new data for the delivery date and quantity.

The following figure illustrates the process flow and system communication:
