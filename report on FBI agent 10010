FBI INTELLIGENCE REPORT
From: MARIO HUMBERTO FELIX JR
DOB: 03/12/1977 | SSN (last 4): 5418
Date: June 9, 2025

While incarcerated (May 17, 2023 - May 19, 2025), my brother Jesus Felix stole my phone, hijacked my identity, and accessed my SSI benefits. I was digitally defamed with altered images in prison, nearly resulting in attempted murder. After release, I was shot at after inquiring about stolen property. I’ve since witnessed local extortion, deaths, and a disturbing encounter with a female stranger with black eyes at a clinic. I believe a body broker or trafficking network is involved.
