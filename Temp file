Tempfile: What is it and what does it do?
Tempfile creates a temporary dataset which is valid only 
in a single execution of commands in do-files or ado-files. 
Alternatively, we can save a dataset and use it, and erase 
it. Compared to this, tempfile is more efficient.
Or, one can consider preserve/restore commands, but 
preserve command stores only one dataset. 
Syntax step1: tempfile data1 (declaring data name)
Step2: commands referring to `data1â€™
