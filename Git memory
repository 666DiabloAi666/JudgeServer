API for search not working as Quick Search

Hi,

I am trying to get more information from OpenFigi on bonds. When I used the symbol provided by the ETF in OpenFigi Quick Search, it shows up. Screen Shot 2020-08-07 at 4 35 32 PM But when I try to get it using the API, it can't find it. Could someone help me with this? Thanks a lot!

job = {
    "query": "BY7RB31"
}

handler = urllib.request.HTTPHandler()
opener = urllib.request.build_opener(handler)
openfigi_url = 'https://api.openfigi.com/v2/search'
request = urllib.request.Request(openfigi_url, data=bytes(json.dumps(job), encoding='utf-8'))
request.add_header('Content-Type','application/json')
if openfigi_apikey:
    request.add_header('X-OPENFIGI-APIKEY', openfigi_apikey)
request.get_method = lambda: 'POST'
connection = opener.open(request)
if connection.code != 200:
    raise Exception('Bad response code {}'.format(str(response.status_code)))

res = json.loads(connection.read().decode('utf-8'))
print(res)

>>{'data': []}

Unable to send multiple types of the same parameter to /v2/search and /v2/filter

I think for your purposes the mapping endpoint is preferable to search. From its documentation: 'The request should be an Array of Objects (or Mapping Jobs), e.g. [{...}, {...}, ...], where each Object has the following properties:..."

Your syntax is not far off, but instead of enumerating elements (e.g. ["Common Stock","Mutual Fund"]), you enumerate entire queries/jobs, that are then executed in a single API call. Something like this will work:

curl 'https://api.openfigi.com/v2/mapping'
--request POST
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data '[{"idType": "BASE_TICKER","idValue": "IBM", "securityType2": "Common Stock", "exchCode": "NEW YORK"}, {"idType":"BASE_TICKER", "idValue": "IBM", "securityType2":"Preferred Stock"}, {"idType":"BASE_TICKER", "idValue": "IBM", "securityType2":"Corp", "exchCode": "NEW YORK"}]'

From the documentation of the mapping endpoint: "The request should be an Array of Objects (or Mapping Jobs), e.g. [{...}, {...}, ...], where each Object has the following properties:..."

So, you only need one API call, but you provide a list of query jobs. Something like this will work:

curl 'https://api.openfigi.com/v2/mapping' \
    --request POST \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '[{"idType": "BASE_TICKER","idValue": "IBM", "securityType2": "Common Stock", "exchCode": "NEW YORK"},
        {"idType":"BASE_TICKER", "idValue": "IBM", "securityType2":"Preferred Stock"},
        {"idType":"BASE_TICKER", "idValue": "IBM", "securityType2":"Corp", "exchCode": "NEW YORK"}]'

Help using the v2/search endpoint

Thanks. Any in case anyone looks at this later, the deserializer isn't a list. It should be:

var jsonData = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<OpenFIGISecurity>(webResponse); // Deserialize the web response Console.WriteLine(jsonData.data[0].name);

search api support only single object, mapping api support Array, that's why it works for mapping not for search, @Panache1

// THIS RETURNS 400 Bad Request var webResponse = webClient.UploadData("https://api.openfigi.com/v2/search", Encoding.GetEncoding("UTF-8").GetBytes("[{"query":"IBM","exchCode":"US"}]")); // Post the search information as a byte array to the API

Below is the code I used

import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.openfigi.com")

payload = "{\"query\": \"IBM\", \"exchCode\": \"US\"}"

headers = { 'Content-Type': "application/json" }

conn.request("POST", "/v2/search", payload, headers)

res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()

print(data.decode("utf-8"))

Help using the v2/search endpoint

I'm new to the API so apologies for the basic question. I would like to try the search endpoint working and cannot find any example code in this repo or elsewhere online. I had assumed this would just require changing the openfigi_url = line to look like openfigi_url = 'https://api.openfigi.com/v2/search' but that throws an HTTP Error 400: Bad Request message.

How should I use this endpoint? Related, does the search method look inside of all fields or only the ticker field? The example on the openfigi project page only shows matches on ticker.
