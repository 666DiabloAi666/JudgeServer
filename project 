Project Name: ClearMyRecord-AI

Objective: Create a secure, AI-powered system to assist in automatically generating high-quality legal motions for expungement, tailored to federal or state courts.


---

1. System Overview

A modular intelligent system that:

Evaluates criminal record eligibility for expungement.

Automatically generates personalized petitions and legal justifications.

Provides judge-targeted summaries with legal citations.

Uses predictive modeling to estimate expungement success likelihood.

Interfaces with JudgeServer or similar AI legal frameworks.



---

2. Core Components

A. Legal NLP Engine (Python - FastAPI)

Functions:

Parse criminal record documents (PDF, text, etc.).

Extract charge types, sentencing, and timelines.

Match against state/federal expungement criteria.


Libraries:

spaCy, transformers, langchain, Haystack



B. Eligibility Inference Engine (Python)

Input: Record details

Model: Trained on historical expungement cases

Output: Yes/No + Legal reasons

Model type: XGBoost/Transformer hybrid


C. Motion Generator (Rust + LLM backend)

Uses structured legal templates.

Dynamically populates court forms and rationale.

Cites case law, time served, rehabilitation evidence.


D. Judge Profile Optimizer

Optional ML model trained on public judge opinions.

Personalizes language, tone, and legal references.

Embeds bias correction and fairness filters.


E. Secure Evidence Uploader

Upload: Education, employment, rehab, volunteer work.

AI verifies content for admissibility and relevance.


F. FastAPI Web Interface (Python)

Accepts user input securely.

Shows preview of motion and court documents.

Displays expungement success score (confidence %).

3. Integration with JudgeServer

Use JudgeServer’s plugin system to simulate ruling outcomes.

Add custom modules:

FederalMotionFormatter

RehabilitationEvidenceWeightScorer

OutcomePredictorAI

5. Ethical & Legal Guardrails

Red-flag system for federal non-expungable crimes.

Consent and privacy-first design (GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).

Audit log of AI decisions and legal basis.



---

6. Federal-Level Legal Considerations

U.S. federal expungement is very limited. AI must:

Identify non-conviction records (e.g., dismissed charges).

Suggest Presidential Pardon application if no expungement path exists.

Offer jurisdictional transfer suggestions where applicable.

7. Example Output Snippet for a Judge

> "Your Honor, pursuant to United States v. Doe, 964 F. Supp. 2d 901 (N.D. Ill. 2013), and in light of my client’s clean record for over 10 years, full employment, and substantial volunteer work, we respectfully request expungement of dismissed charges under Rule 410. The rehabilitative factors and public interest weigh in favor of a fresh start."
